"""
Shared Assessment/Recording Engine — the foundation story both Pronunciation Coach
(services/pronunciation_coach_service.py, US-95) and Accent Assessment
(services/accent_assessment_service.py, US-93/US-89) call into, so neither duplicates
audio decoding, VAD, STT, or alignment logic.

Pure analysis only — no DB access, no HTTP concerns — so it's unit-testable in
isolation (see tests/test_recording_engine.py) and reusable by any future feature that
needs "record against a target text and get back what was said."
